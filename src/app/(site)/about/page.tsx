          Embellish Antiques is a Durham, North Carolina-based dealer specializing in
          hand-selected antique and vintage pieces — from Art Deco barware and monumental
          French lighting to one-of-a-kind case goods and garden furniture. Every item is
          personally sourced and chosen for character, not just condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ship nationwide and worldwide from our Durham warehouse, and every piece that
          passes through our doors is one of a kind — once it&apos;s gone, it&apos;s gone.
          That&apos;s part of the appeal: you&apos;re not buying something mass-produced,
          you&apos;re giving an object with real history a second life.
